            "summary": "Stroke experts say it is crucial to develop innovative, technology-driven strategies to meet the growing needs of stroke survivors in India. SMART is a comprehensive solution for stroke care comprising of - 1. SMART EEG headset and 2. SMART app having diagnostic and rehabilitation tools.\n\nI have developed the SMART EEG headset - a wearable EEG device costing less than ₹7,000 (US$100), several times cheaper than commercial EEG devices. It consists of 1. An ergonomic 3-D printed headset., 2. A signal processing module using a low-cost Arduino board and EEG Click (an IC to amplify and filter bio-signals). The EEG signals from the headset are analyzed using Fourier transforms (FFT) for classification into alpha, beta, and theta waves in the SMART app.\n\nThe SMART app developed using Android SDK in Java has two key modules - 1. Stroke Diagnostics and 2.Rehabilitation. The diagnosis module uses EEG to calculate DAR levels and identify stroke patients and the rehabilitation module has an interactive game based on EEG neurofeedback training to help stroke patients improve their alpha brainwave activity and aid recovery. \n\nIn order to test the reliability of the SMART EEG headset, I conducted experiments. Each experiment tested a particular stage of the EEG data acquisition process, namely: collecting the raw EEG data, calculating the frequency spectrum and lastly detecting changes in the brainwave state.\n\nI believe SMART could radically improve the delivery of medical care to stroke patients as it is low-cost and easily-accessible, and it empowers the stroke patient to recover at home with minimal medical assistance.",

            "summary": "What is the problem?-\nRoad accidents killed 13.5 lakh people globally in 2018. They are the single largest cause of death for those in the age group of 15-45. Reckless driving is responsible for 90% of road deaths. In order to make our roads safer, a cost-effective and accessible method is needed to monitor and track reckless driving.\n\nMy solution-\nI have developed an Android smartphone application, DriveSafe, which detects reckless driving behaviours in real-time.\n\nSteps for development-\nI identified the major reckless driving behaviours. These are:\n  a. Overspeeding\n  b. Sudden braking\n  c. Sudden acceleration\n  d. Sharp turning\t\n\nI developed an app which detects the above behaviours. In this app:\n  a. Accelerometer sensor is used to measure acceleration in 3D space. Haversine formula is applied to calculate distances and speed from GPS coordinates. \n  b. The data collected is stored in a csv file for later analysis.\n  c. The user interface was integrated with Google Maps API to provide the user with an interactive experience.\n\nThe app was run on Bangalore roads over 2 months. The acceleration in all 3 axes, the speed, the time and the location of the vehicle was recorded every second. Using the data, I set appropriate thresholds for the rash driving behaviours.\n\nDriveSafe can be used to monitor reckless driving behaviours with a high accuracy and improve road safety by individuals, fleet operators, insurance companies, and traffic police.",
